# Healthare High Relevance Clinical Terms (HRCT)
The goal with Healthcare HRCT is to find the clinically relevant terms in documents to help identify the patients that are likely to end up with a particular diagnosis. The hope is that by identifying the patient's primary issue, treatment can be carried out earlier resulting in more positive outcomes, especially where a patient only has a small timeframe to get treatment to result in a positive outcome such as a severe sepsis diagnosis.
